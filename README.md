### Files

* Core
    * [odes.py](odes.py) defines the model as a system of differential
	  equations and functions for building initial conditions and
	  solving the model.
    * [parameters.py](parameters.py) defines two baseline parameter
      sets, one for a persistent pathogen and one for a non-persistent
      pathogen.
	* [common.py](common.py) has common definitions and functions used
      by the analysis and plotting scripts.
* Analysis & plotting scripts
	* [solutions.py](solutions.py) plots model solutions vs. time for
      the two basic parameter sets.
    * [growth_rates.py](growth_rates.py) analyzes & plots the pathogen
      intrinsic growth rate vs. initial vector population size.
    * [sensitivity_1param.py](sensitivity_1param.py) analyzes & plots
      the sensitivity of the pathogen intrinsic growth rate to the
	  parameters, 1 parameter at a time.
	* [sensitivity_2params.py](sensitivity_2params.py) analyzes & plots
      the sensitivity of the pathogen intrinsic growth rate to the
	  parameters, 2 parameters at a time.
	* [sensitivity_pairs.py](sensitivity_pairs.py) analyzes & plots
      the sensitivity of the pathogen intrinsic growth rate to the
	  parameters, for pairs of parameters that are linked to each
      other.
